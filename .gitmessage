Replace this line with imperative summary

An awesome description describing WHY this work over HOW/WHAT it does.
The diff attached to commit should describe implementation (HOW)

# [Ticket #12]

#-----------------------------------------------@----------------------#
#
# 1. Summary should be under 50 characters. @-symbol above is a marker
#    for that.
#
# 2. Description of commit should explain WHY a change was made and
#    lines should be wrapped to 72 characters; marked by the #-symbol.
#
# 3. Optionally, reference a ticket number. If needed, uncomment and
#    go to town.
